    <h2>Autodesk AutoCAD is a popular computer-aided design (CAD) software used for creating precise 2D and 3D drawings. A "fab lab" is short for "fabrication laboratory," where people can create prototypes, designs, and even final products using various digital fabrication tools like 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, and more.

        If you're looking for information on how to use AutoCAD within a fab lab context, you might be interested in learning how to design objects that can be fabricated using these tools, such as creating 3D models for printing or generating laser-cut designs. Feel free to provide more specific details about what you're looking for, and I'll be glad to assist you further!</h2>
