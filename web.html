    <h2>Web development is a fundamental module in many Fab Labs, which are creative digital fabrication laboratories that provide access to modern technology for learning and innovation. In the context of a Fab Lab, the web development module would focus on teaching participants how to create and manage websites. Here's a general overview of what this module might entail:</h2>

    <h2>The Web Development module in our Fab Lab introduces participants to the world of creating and maintaining websites. This module covers the fundamental aspects of web development, empowering individuals to design, code, and launch their own web projects. Through hands-on activities and practical exercises, participants will gain a solid foundation in web technologies, enabling them to express their creativity and ideas in the digital realm.</h2>

    <h1>Key Learning Objectives:</h1>
    <h4>1. Introduction to Web Technologies: FAB MEMBERS will be introduced to the basic concepts of the internet, web browsers, and how websites work. They will learn about the client-server model and the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in building websites.
    </h4>
    <h4>
        2. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):FAB MEMBERS will learn the structure of web pages using HTML. They'll understand how to create headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and other essential HTML elements.</h4>
        <h4>
            3. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): This section covers the basics of CSS, teaching FAB MEMBERS how to style their web pages by controlling layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects.</h4>
            <h4>
                4. JavaScript Fundamentals:An introduction to JavaScript programming will cover essential concepts like variables, data types, conditions, loops, and functions. Participants will learn how to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to their websites.</h4>
                <h4>5. Project Work:Throughout the module, participants will work on hands-on projects that gradually increase in complexity. These projects will allow them to apply the concepts they've learned and build a portfolio of their web development skills.
                </h4>

        <h2>By the end of the Web Development module, participants should have a strong understanding of the core technologies behind websites and have the skills necessary to design, develop, and deploy their web projects. This knowledge can serve as a solid foundation for further exploration into more advanced web development topics.</h2>
